# CLI ASCII PRESENTATION
*cli-ascii-presentation* is a presentation for the command line. It prints *.txt*-files listed in a pres_conf.yml to the terminal.  


### How To
Create you textfiles in a subfolder. Use no *"\n"* at the end of a line, cli-ascii-presentation adds this for you. Create a pres_conf.yml-file in the location you want to run cli-ascii-presentation from.  
Add each file with its path on a new line in the file. Save it and run using "ascii-pres".
